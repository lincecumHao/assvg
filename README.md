#What is AsSVG?

AsSVG may best be described as a couple of efforts to enable and thus promote the use of SVG in Open Source GIS software. It started with a function to deliver SVG-notation from PostgreSQL with PostGIS called AsSVG() back in 2005. In spring 2008 v.out.svg was included in GRASS GIS 6.3 and in autumn 2008 PostGIS' ASSVG() function was ported to Spatialite, an extension that enables spatial data support in SQLite. Besides that there's a simple ArcGIS geoprocessing script with toolbox that you can find here.

# Fork From AsSVG, What a Great tool for convert Shapefile to SVG w/ attribute data.
這份Fork 主要提供給 中文使用者, 如果是中文的話用這個Tool 會有亂碼
所以花了點時間看了一下 code 讓他能夠正確輸出中文.
其他使用方式跟AsSVG相同
